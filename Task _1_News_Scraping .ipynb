       " 'At the 2016 Mumbai marathon, Malayali runner T Gopi was a pacemaker for the participants from the army.\\nIt was his first ever marathon and never before, not even for practice, had he run a 42 km distance. In the run’s next edition in January, he will be taking part as India’s first Asian Marathon Championship winner, in the men’s category! The 29-year-old army man from Sulthan Bathery is just back in India after the historic feat and is full of thrilling memories from the event, which was held in China.\\n“Till about 37 km, eight runners including me were striding forward as a bunch,” recalls Gopi. “After that, slowly, people started lagging behind. At 40 km, there were just four of us. Thankfully, my energy reserves were still intact and I understood that maybe, this is going to be my event. When I pulled a little ahead and tried, I could see the next runner wasn’t catching up. I also knew his timings and personal best and so, I became sure,” says the runner, who clocked the win at 2 hours 15 mins and 48 seconds, followed by Andrey Petrov of Uzbekistan and Byambalev Tseveenravdan of Mongolia.\\nWhen he ran the Mumbai marathon, Gopi says he had no clue that any of it, including a berth in Brazil Olympics or the Asian title, were waiting for him in the future. “I have been someone who does 10,000 meters and 5,000 meters athletic events but I had never given a marathon serious thought. Even when my coach Surender Singh asked me to run as a pacemaker in Mumbai, all I thought about was ‘I should do the pacing well in a good time.’ It’s after I qualified for the Olympics that I felt that maybe, this is something I can excel at,” he says, with a laugh. Taking part in a few more events and winning prizes further boosted his confidence.\\nThe champion says that he has been quite injury-prone and has also some continuity issues that are affecting his performance. continued from page 1\\n“Now, I am trying out some new workouts and techniques, which, I guess, are helping me move in the right direction and reduce injuries. I am looking forward to the next set of trainings, with my coach.”\\nGopi is also thrilled about the emerging running culture in Kerala over the past few years, and says that it’s helping the sport immensely.\\n“I’m really happy that Kerala is now catching up with the rest of the world, when it comes to running events. It has a fun part for sure, but this trend also helps both serious runners and amateur participants of the State, fitness and discipline-wise, and also to improve their performance with each event, as there are many competitions now. I can see that a lot of people are putting in some dedicated effort and that’s promising. It’s not always about the medal, but also about the health and sportsmanship,” he says.\\nHe is focusing next on the Mumbai and Delhi marathons next year; and Asian Games in Indonesia in August, 2018. There is also the national record of 2 hours 12 minutes in the event, that he has set his eyes on. “It’s not possible to bring down my running time to that level within a short duration and it calls for a lot more of work, but I hope that by the time I compete in the Asian Games, I would be able to run in that range,” signs off the champion.',\n",

The santhe is not only about a trip to paradise for your taste buds, but also gives visitors a chance to play interesting games and take part in educative sessions on the art of brewing a perfect cup of coffee with the use of various brewing equipment. For the young ones, there’s a fancy dress contest on the theme, ‘Expressing the uses of coffee’, as well as an art competition.\\nAnd what’s more, while browsing at the 40-odd stalls at the santhe, visitors will be enthralled with live music.

The winners will go on to represent the country at the world brewing championship. “The objective behind this championship is to encourage women baristas, as not many are given the right opportunity. These women will follow world brewing standards while preparing coffee,” says Radhika Uttapa, president of the WCAI.',\n",
       " 'As a little girl, she would always find humour in even the most serious of situations. She looked at life itself in a lighter vein and invariably spoke her thoughts. She made people around her laugh but was always tagged as ‘ outspoken, vayadi, thanthonni’ etc. Years passed and the little girl is now a successful radio jockey, and the same sense of humour is now making the world laugh. RJ Neena, who works in a popular radio station in Kochi, divulges that there is nothing she enjoys more than her profession as she is a person who loves to laugh and crack jokes, by default. “The change in people’s attitude towards a woman being funny is very much visible. My journey from the outspoken girl to a woman with good sense of humour has been thrilling. I have made crazy mistakes by cracking jokes in inappropriate situations but I have learned to channelize my sense of humour now,” she says.\\nGone are the days when society proclaimed that humour is solely a man’s domain. That when a woman says a man is funny, it is equivalent to man saying a woman is pretty. The idea of women and humour being antithetical is slowly vanishing and women are increasingly getting a license to use humour confidently and liberally. In fact, a sense of humour only makes a woman more charismatic today. What is behind the change in the attitude?\\n“Thanks to liberalisation, women now have a space in society, which could be the major reason for this transformation. Popular culture always reflects changes in society and now, with women becoming more prominent in arts, media, politics, academia and sports, we are just as confident about using humour as our male contemporaries,” says actress Manju Pillai, known for her brilliant comic timing in shows like Thatteem Mutteem and Laughing Villa. The power of humour, she says, is better utilised now than ever and women too have started exploring it. “Who doesn’t love a good laugh? It is one of the best medicines for all ailments and 90% of those who give me feedback for Thatteem Mutteem say it provides them a lot of relaxation. The majority of them are women. The power of humour should never be underestimated, be it to diffuse a potential conflict, to build relationships or to get ahead at work,” she adds.\\nAccording to R J Neena, women have become more aware of their capabilities and this has in turn boosted their confidence. “The self-confidence comes from within themselves and the major reason is the receptiveness of society. Women are increasingly experimenting with humour in their professional and personal lives, just as on the comedy circuit,” she says.\\nThe change began in the early 2000s, according to director-writer Madhupal, who adds that the era saw media offering space to witty women – be it in television, radio, theatre or politics. On TV, we saw many reality shows coming up which had homemakers facing the camera for the first time. The family reality shows saw them doing the quirkiest of tasks and the audience reacted with laughter.”\\nThe change was also visible in films, and female leads started showing their funny side, he says. “In the past, actors like Adoor Bhasi or S P Pillai monopolised the comic scenes, which ran parallel to the story, but later heroines like Urvashi, Kalpana and Manju Warrier started exploring the humour in a story. For example, Manju’s How Old Are You saw even a fall of hers being celebrated as funny,” he explains, adding that humour has really helped people overcome their inhibitions.\\n“Funniness isn’t gender specific or situation specific now. Even in real life, women don’t hesitate to give a counter comment. In fact humour sells most now. And an RJ becomes exciting only if she/he can crack a good joke. The same is the situation in films and it has in turn, influenced the society at grass-root levels,” he says.\\nLyricist Manu Manjith quotes a line of Sreevidya from the Mohanlal movie Aram Thampuran, “Pennungal ummarathu vannu ninnu abhiprayam parayunna sheelam ee tharavattililla’…that was the level of freedom of women. Over the years, not just the attitude of society but that of women themselves towards humour has changed.”\\nManu feels that sense of humour was always there within women, and they started expressing it only later. “Research has found that men and women share pretty much the same humour-response system. I feel women always had it in them but it is only now that they started airing it aloud. The transformation has been clearly mentioned in VT Bhattathiripad’s Adukkalayil Ninnum Arangathekku. For a long time, we never saw women talking in a loud voice or laughing hard, except in novels such as Indulekha, which had imaginary characters. On the contrary, now we see women humourists in all fields, and women being active participants in conversations that were once ruled by men,” he says. “Just as women have started talking openly about menstruation, they have started cracking jokes as well. Their comfort zones have expanded. It is a very positive change and a strong step towards women liberation. Yes, laughing out loud is a crucial element of being free,” he sums up.',\n",

An unsuspecting person may be eager to open the parcel, but that can be dangerous. Similarly apps may contain malware, spyware and ransomware,” said K Srinivasan, co-founder of Digital Security Association of India. “Many people using these apps are least bothered and they are feeding all their personal photos and videos into these apps without thinking of the consequences,” he said.\\nCybercrime experts recommend updating of applications and software whenever available to prevent hacking. “Hackers work day and night to crack a legit software. That is the reason why the developer also updates and releases newer versions to counter the hackers,” a cybercrime expert said.\\nRajendran said while user privacy was a priority, it had a flip side. “Photos, videos and documents shared over WhatsApp are protected against unauthorised access. WhatsApp does not store the messages on its servers. But the flip side is that this very assurance raises the concern of government investigators engaged in solving cybercrime cases and combating cyberterrorism,” he said.\\nAnd while new features in apps are welcomed by users for their convenience, the same are put to ill use by criminals. “WhatsApp’s update to delete a sent message is indeed a useful tool, but it is an added nightmare for cybercrime investigators because the evidence of messages exchanged between criminals and terrorists could be destroyed easily,” he said.',\n",

       " 'THANE: Residents from Thane have been affected the most with the killer HIV virus. Out of 2,304 HIV positive patients in the district, around 33% were from Thane city, including Mira Road and Bhayander. This was stated in the 2016-17 report of Thane’s District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). However, there has been a drop in the number of cases in the entire district.\\nThe officials claimed that Thane city, comprising of Thane, Mira Road and Bhayander, had more people who belong to the high risk population. Navi Mumbai and Bhiwandi were among the top three places in the district that were detected with the most number of cases.\\n“These cities not only have a high population, but also have people from the high risk zone —like sex workers, migrants, transgenders, truck drivers, etc. It was also seen that out of the ones who were detected positive, 80% got infected due to unsafe sex. While others got it through blood transfusion. Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus. This drop is because of the awareness drives being carried out by various organisations,” said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of theDAPCU.\\nThe department, along with 33 NGOs, conduct awareness drives on regular basis and focus more on the people belonging to the high risk communities.\\n“Out of those who fall under the high risk category, the highest number of people tested positive were migrant workers and and truck drivers. But there has been a rise in the number of patients taking the HIV test. This is because of the awareness drives we have been carrying out in these pockets. During these drives, we request those infected with the virus to come to the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre for tests,” said Gadhave.\\nHowever, there has been a drop in HIV positive cases in the district. This is an indication that the awareness drives and sensitization programmes organized by the state authorities and voluntary groups in the last seven years has shown positive results. While there were 5,154 HIV cases in 2010-11, the numbers came down to around 2,304 in 2016-2017.',\n",

       " 'Bengaluru, in terms of theatre, is a thriving city that not only celebrates traditional drama, but also accommodates contemporary, experimental works. This, in turn, is helping a growing group of independent artistes, playwrights as well as collectives to come up with new concepts in the field of performing arts. Cut to theatre festivals, the city is hosting a first-of-its-kind event, which has not only chosen an alternative space to stage the plays, but is also showcasing the works of women directors from a different vantage point. Called\\nDum Dama Dum: Children’s Theatre and Reading Festival\\n, the event is slated to take place at Atta Galatta from December 1-3.\\nAbsorb and reflect\\n\\n“One of the high points of the festival is that five of the six plays that form part of it are by women directors. This was not a deliberate attempt; things just unfolded like that. Dramatics are often just seen as an extra-curricular activity in school or college. Even some of the most memorable plays from our childhood days are mostly the works of Shakespeare or other classics. Through this festival, we are trying to put the focus back on local writings, and encouraging children to absorb and reflect on day-to-day stories in an open-stage environment. Also, because the fest is being held at a bookshop, children will get the opportunity to read and watch at the same place,” says Vikram Sridhar, curator of the festival.\\nBreaking free from the ‘cute factor’\\n\\nDrama Queen’s Anuja Ghosalkar, who is the brains behind the play Z Glitch, says, “It is high time we break free from the ‘cute factor’ that is often associated with kids performing on stage. Through this play, which is set in a library where an error in code deletes all books, we are trying to focus on the intellectual aspect of a generation that is engrossed in technology. Loosely inspired by Haruki Murakami’s book The Strange Library, the play is devised by a bunch of kids, aged between eight and 14 years. All the kids are home-schooled, wherein they are taught to study almost everything through theatre. Even the dialogues in the play are carefully chosen words that children use in today’s world. The play is organic and intimate in nature. The makeup of these little actors is also being done by a child — a 10-year-old girl.”\\nHigh creative quotient\\n\\nNandini Rao’s The Flying Marbles is another interesting piece of work that is being showcased at the fest. Based on Berlin’s Grips-Theatre format, this theatrical, presented by Yours Truly Theatre, comprises three short stories that shed light on the conflicts and problems that children face at different stages of their growing period, such as blame and shame, peer pressure, embarrassment, good touch and bad touch. “Every tale has 4-5 characters, which are enacted by adults as kids. We are using the complete-the-story technique in the play. The performance stops at a crucial point, allowing members of the audience to fill in the plot,” explains Nandini, adding, “Local involvement and the creative quotient make this festival an engaging event for the young theatre enthusiasts in the city. Performing at a non-conventional space will also enable children to be more comfortable and open up new ways of learning through what they see and experience.”\\nThe other plays at the fest…\\n\\nSome Some Story by Anvitha Prakash (PuppeTree)\\nThe Abimanyu Project by Kirtana Kumar (Theatre Lab)\\nTown Musicians of Brehmen by Surabhi nVasisht (NamKampani Theatr)\\nRobi’s Garden by Vijay Padaki (Bangalore Little Theatre)',\n",
       " 'KOTA: Two brothers separated from their mother and maternal grandmother about nine years ago from Tilaswa village in Bhilwara district reunited with the family by Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Kota, on Wednesday tells an intriguing story that is no less than a movie plot.\\nCWC, Kota has raised a question on the role of CWC Ujjain in releasing them from children shelter home in Ujjain and now decided to write to concerned legal bodies to order an inquiry into the matter.\\nAnil, a 16-year-old boy was rescued from Kota railway station on October 28, 2017 and during the preliminary investigation and counselling by CWC, he narrated a chain of events that led to trace his elder brother Sunil and mother Dhapubai, around 25-27 years old from Rao community, told Harish Gurubaxani, chairman of CWC, Kota.\\nThe rescued boy Anil narrated that he and his brother Sunil around 8-9 years ago had left their maternal grandmother’s home in Tilaswa village for the fear of being rebuked and punished by maternal uncles whose goats had gone missing in the jungle while the two brothers were grazing them, Gurubaxani said.\\nThe two brothers were later rescued by CWC Ujjain and were sent to children shelter home of the city where they stayed till they were sent to Foster Care Centre in Chittorgarh in Rajasthan a few months ago. The rescued boy Anil in the counselling with CWC members could recall only the name of his village Tilaswa. During the investigation in the matter it was found out that two minor boys had gone missing from around eight to nine years ago from a Rao’ home and following which their mother Dhapubai was traced. During the counselling, the rescued brother Anil narrated that he along with his brother Sunil were sent by Foster Centre to skill development training by ICICI bank in Kanpur where he could not stay and ran away from the skill development centre and was rescued by CWC Kota from railway station last month. On this disclosure, the elder brother Sunil was also traced and called in Kota from the skill development centre. The two bothers through the inborn identical marks and characteristics on their bodies were confirmed to be the sons of Dhapubai, the CWC chairperson said.\\nThe tale of the mother of the two sons Dhapubai is also not less pathetic and miserable, told CWC chairman. The mother narrated the CWC that she was too abducted by her brother in law Shambhu while she was only six years old. At the age of 16 and 17 she delivered two sons Sunil and Anil in a period of about one and one and a half years and the father of her kids is her brother in law Shambhu, the mother told CWC. She lived with her brother in law at several places but one day when her sons were about six and seven years old respectively, she fled from the brother in law’s home and reached her parent in Tilaswa village. The parents and family members next time did not allow the brother in law to take her back but sent her with another man Mahaveer on Nata Pratha, a community based tradition to keep a woman as wife by getting possession over her with money to her parents. The two little brother were left with their maternal grandmother in Tilaswa village from where they also went missing while they were grazing goats in the jungle.\\nThe happiness and elation was overwhelming yesterday with the two brothers and their mother after their reunion. The mother was extremely happy and feeling fortunate to have her sons in life again after so many years.\\nMeanwhile, CWC, Kota has raised question on the role of CWC, Ujjain in determining their age. The age of the rescued minor, through medical examination, boy was confirmed around 16 years, told Harish Gurubaxani asking CWC, Ujjain can release the two boys from Foster Centre without their getting to adulthood. He would write to the concerned legal bodies in Madhya Pradesh (M.P.) demanding to order a probe in the matter, CWC chairman, Gurubaxani said.',\n",
       " 'JAISALMER: Around 12 Griffon vultures, a schedule I category bird, were run over by train near Chacha railway station under Pokhran sub-division. The death of vultures came to light late on Wednesday following which a team from the forest department rushed to the spot.\\n\\nSources revealed that some villagers were passing through the area when they noticed carcasses of the birds strewn on both sides of the tracks. The villagers then intimated the regional forest officer in Lathi, Prakash Singh Juktawat who rushed to the area with other officers.\\n\\nSources revealed that lots of vultures have migrated from across the border these days. \"There was a group of 50 vultures that were feasting on a carcass when the incident happened. The driver of the train tried his best and blew the horn many a times but that could not prevent the death of about a dozen of these as the train over them,\" sources informed.\\n\\nAccording to DFO Khyati Mathur, “We were intimated late last evening about the incident after which we have sent a team there. As of now our people are collecting the body parts of the birds as they got scattered. A confirmation on the reason of their death will come through only after a post-mortem as also the exact number of birds that were killed.”\\n\\n“These birds appear to have migrated to the place from far away. It is usual for these birds to come here during winter. However they were taken unawares by the train and died,” she added.\\nIn April this year, in a similar incident, Bikaner saw its largest ever mass mortality among birds after 31 vultures were mowed down by a train. The accident had occurred at Jorbeer, proposed to be an Important Bird Area (IBA) conservation site.']"
